## Professional Experience
### Cylab Biometrics Center, Carnegie Mellon University, USA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sep 2016 - 2018

   ***Research Associate***

* *Deep Learning Models for Face Matching*
* *Soft biometrics with age and gender estimation*
* *Tractable Deep Generative Models for Longitudinal Face Modeling* 
* *Generative Adversarial Networks for Face Modeling*
* *Deep Learning Models for Scene Parsing*

### Concordia University, Canada &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jan 2013 - 2016
***Research Assistant***
* *Deep Generative Model for Longitudinal Face Modeling*
* *Deep Boltzmann Machines for Face Modeling*: proposed a novel Deep Appearance
Models (DAMs) approach to accurately capture both shape and texture of face images under large variations. This model can be used as an efficient replacement for Active Appearance Models (AAMs).
* *Low rank matrix factorization, Compressed sensing, Sparse representation and dictionary learning*: evaluating the sparse representation based system for face recognition with occlusions.
* *Handwritten character recognition*: applied the theories of sparse representation and dictionary learning to handwritten character recognition.

### National Institute of Informatics, Tokyo Japan &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feb 2012 - Aug 2012
***Research Intern***
* *Eye Localization in Video*: proposed to combine both tracker and detector for robust eye localization in video. The new system can overcome challenging factors such as: extreme head pose change, closed eyes and occlusion.
* *Video Aesthetic Assessment*: proposed a system to automatically extract the beautiful scene in broadcast videos. Four scene-level features for scene aesthetic assessment including (1) length of scene, (2) scene difference, (3) overall picture of scene and (4) object interestingness are designed. These four features will fully exploit the temporal information and provide a better understanding of human impression from scene.
* *Face Recognition*

### FPT Software, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jun 2007 - Aug 2007
***Software and Web Design Engineer Intern***
* Designed and developed a web-based translated document management system.

### University of Science, Vietnam 
***Research Assistant*** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sep 2009 - Feb 2012
* *Facial Age Estimation*: proposed an advanced age-estimation approach that combines global and local features derived from a facial image.
* *Digital Image Tampering Detection using Color Filter Array*.

***Undergraduate Student*** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sep 2004 - Aug 2008
* *Video Watermarking*: applied DCT and DWT techniques to embed copyright information to video and proposed a new method that combines these techniques to improve the scheme’s robustness.
• A project in Handwritten characters recognition using Feed-Forward Neural Network.
• A course project in Image Processing: develop Traffic Sign Detection with four kinds
of sign: circle, triangle, rectangle and square.
