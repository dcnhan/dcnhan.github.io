## Professional Experience
#### Cylab Biometrics Center, Carnegie Mellon University, USA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sep 2016 - 2018

   ***Research Associate***

* Deep Learning Models for Face Matching
* Soft biometrics with age and gender estimation
* Tractable Deep Generative Models for Longitudinal Face Modeling 
* Generative Adversarial Networks for Face Modeling
* Deep Learning Models for Scene Parsing

#### Concordia University, Canada &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jan 2013 - 2016
***Research Assistant***
* Deep Generative Model for Longitudinal Face Modeling
* Deep Boltzmann Machines for Face Modeling: proposed a novel Deep Appearance
Models (DAMs) approach to accurately capture both shape and texture of face images under large variations. This model can be used as an efficient replacement for Active Appearance Models (AAMs).
* Low rank matrix factorization, Compressed sensing, Sparse representation and dictio- nary learning: evaluating the sparse representation based system for face recognition with occlusions.
* Handwritten character recognition: applied the theories of sparse representation and dictionary learning to handwritten character recognition.
