I'm a Senior Technical Staff of DeepcamAI. My research interests lie in the fields of computer vision, deep learning and reinforcement learning. 

I received the B.S. and M.Sc. degrees in Computer Science from Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Information Technology, University of Science, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, in 2008 and 2012, respectively. I was an Intern with National Institute of Informatics, Tokyo, Japan in 2012. I received the Ph.D. degree in Computer Science with the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada, under supervisons of [Prof. T. D. Bui](https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~bui/) and [Prof. Khoa Luu](http://csce.uark.edu/~khoaluu/). 
From 2016 to 2018, I was a Research Associate at CyLab Biometrics Center, Carnegie Mellon University.
